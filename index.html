                <h2>2025 Marketing Budget Planning (First-Time VPs)</h2>
                <div class="date">Refreshed: Dec 28, 2024 | Original: November 1, 2023</div>
                <p>It's budget planning season. If you're a first time VP of marketing (or an interim one, because the old one got fired), how much should you spend on marketing?</p>
                    
                <p>Is your budget too big? Are you spending enough?</p>
                
                <p>After speaking with a dozen finance and GTM leaders this quarter (Q4 FY2024), here are my most important takeaways around marketing budgets and 2025 planning:</p>
                
                <p><strong>First the benchmarks:</strong></p>
                
                <p>According to ICONIQ, early stage companies at $1M to $25M ARR, spend 30-55% of revenue on marketing.</p>
                
                <p>Marketing budget or "program spend" is typically 50% of this number. Headcount is the other 50%. Thus for an early stage startup, I'd expect the marketing budget to be about 15-25% of revenue. Sources: ICONIQ and Carilu Dietrich.</p>
                
                <p>However, you can't talk about marketing budgets without talking about company strategy. Here are a few important considerations to inform the size and makeup of your marketing budget:</p>
                
                <p>1. The CEO sets the company strategy, which includes GTM (sales and marketing). Business goals â†’ GTM strategy â†’ Marketing strategy â†’ Marketing programs.</p>
                
                <p>2. CEOs shouldn't stretch revenue targets. The revenue plan is not where you coerce your sales leader to do more with less. It's where you are making a realistic projection on your business. Good CEOs deliver on the plan. (Dave Kellog)</p>
                
                <p>3. The GTM strategy is constrained by the revenue targets (ARR, MRR) and financial guidelines (CAC ratio, CAC to LTV, etc). The GTM strategy should also align with the product strategy. Good sellers won't sell what they don't believe in.</p>
                
                <p>4. CAC ratio = (sales & marketing expense) / new revenue. For every dollar you put in, you get X dollars back. For early stage startups, this number can be higher, but I'd question the unit economics if this approaches 2.0. CAC ratio should get more efficient over time, because marketing investments like brand compound.</p>
                
                <p>5. The attribution report is not the marketing strategy. "Number of LinkedIn posts per week" is not the marketing strategy. The marketing strategy is the set of programs and experiments best positioned to help the company achieve its business goals.</p>
                
                <p>6. Marketing leaders should define what programs fall under "productive" spend vs strategic spend (CEO pet projects). Rowan Tomkin recommends spending 55% to 75% of the budget on revenue producing programs. Agencies and contractors are great for flexing experimental or strategic spend.</p>
                
                <p>7. Overall marketing spend includes people and non-people costs, which are generally split 50/50. Where it gets fuzzy are: client meals, technology, and contractors. For contractors: are they <em>actually</em> contractors or are they de facto employees? If it's a contractor or agency that rolls up to a specific program, then it's a true program cost. Otherwise, I think it should be treated as a people cost.</p>
                
                <p>8. Each marketing program should have KPIs that are framed in the context of business goals. Not everything is direct response. My recommendation is to hire program experts who understand the business KPIs and not just the metrics of their platform (SEO, LinkedIn, X etc).</p>

                <p>9. You can always less budget -- but you can't ask for more ðŸ˜‰. </p>
                
                <p>There isn't a "right" answer for how much you should spend on marketing. Instead, make sure your marketing strategy aligns with the company strategy. Design programs that have the best shot at helping the company achieve its goals.</p>
                
                <p>A lot of what I learned also comes from Dave Kellog, Chris Walker, Carilu Dietrich, Peter Mahoney and Rowan Tonkin.</p>
                
                <p>If you're a first time VP, I highly encourage you to follow them on LinkedIn. You can also DM me for my podcast recommendations and Notebook LM overviews on this topic.</p>
                
                <p>Good luck.</p>

            <h2>The Sanctity of the Inbox</h2>
            <div class="date">Refreshed: Dec 28, 2024 | Original: July 10, 2023</div>

            <p>I read a LinkedIn post from a RevOps / salesperson evangelizing what he calls the "triple touch" approach.</p>
   
            <p>When you triple touch a prospect, you ping them on LinkedIn, email, and cell phone... all on the same day.</p>
            
            <p>I don't think you should ever triple touch someone without consent.</p>
            
            <p>And I think that's the problem with this technique. It's a sales "tactic" and not a strategy rooted in deep customer understanding.</p>
            
            <p>Short-term tactics like this are what make sales as a profession feel salesy. Instead, I recommend considering how your customer treats their inbox and finding creative ways to break through the noise on the platforms and communities that they're already participats of.</p>
            
            <p>For example, as a founder, I keep my inboxes religiously separate. I hate it when there's crossover between my personal and work channels.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Channel Priorities Based on Relationship:</strong></p>
            
            <table border="1">

                    <tr>
                        <th>Channel</th>
                        <th>Do I know you? (YES)</th>
                        <th>Do I know you? (NO)</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Voicemail</td>
                        <td>Top priority</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>iMessage</td>
                        <td>High priority, depends on the preview</td>
                        <td>High priority</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Voice memo</td>
                        <td>Medium priority</td>
                        <td>Medium priority, suspicious</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Phone Call</td>
                        <td>Med priority (please just text me)</td>
                        <td>Ignore</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Email</td>
                        <td>Depends on person/subject line</td>
                        <td>Depends on subject line</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>LinkedIn DM</td>
                        <td>Yes, but often swamped</td>
                        <td>Depends on your profile</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>As a customer, I want you to treat my inboxes with respect. Don't call me if you don't know me, especially if it's not urgent.</p>
            
            <p>1. Voicemail<br>
            2. iMessage<br>
            3. Voice memo<br>
            4. Phone Call from known contact<br>
            5. Email from known contact<br>
            6. LinkedIn DM<br>
            7. Email from unknown contact</p>
            
            <p>Think about how you use the different social and messaging apps on your phone.</p>
            
            <p>What are going to the app for? To be entertained? To learn? To look for vendors?</p>
            
            <p>Think think about how to create a thoughtful, personalized outbound message -- one that involves addressing a relevant pain point.</p>
            
            <p>I guarantee you customers are smart enough to see value when you surface it to them. No need to triple touch.</p>
